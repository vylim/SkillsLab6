In my project I will be asking the user to enter a maximum and minium and a number to test to see if it falls withing the range given!

max = int(input("Enter your maximum value: "))
min = int(input("Enter your minimum vlaue: "))
number = int(input("Enter number to test"))

if(number >= min and number <= min):
    print("Your number does fall between this range!")
else:
    print("Sorry your number does not fall between this range")
